# Image-Classification

About DATASET:
MNIST set is a large collection of handwritten digits.
It is a very popular dataset in the field of image processing. 
It is often used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. 

About CNN:
Convolutional Neural Network, also known as CNN or ConvNet is a kind of network architecture for deep learning algorithms and is specifically used for image recognition and tasks that involve the processing of pixel data.
There are other types of neural networks in deep learning, but for identifying and recognizing objects, CNNs are the network architecture of choice
Using this algorithmn it is easier to classify the handwritten digits.

CONCLUSION:
Results are given below
